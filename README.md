# strain2bfunc

## Motivations
The strain-resolved analysis is a widespread demand because the co-existence of strains with distinct functional capacities in the microbial communities indicates unique functional/metabolic capability
* Microbiome association studies: more host phenotypes can be distinguished, which can NOT be achieved at species level or above
* Strain-specific infection: Help physicians make accurate clinical diagnoses, relevant to bacterial resistance to infection
* Explore the transmission/translocation patterns of strain-specific microorganisms

## Key challenges
* The conventional metagenome method requires high sequencing coverage and is thus cost-prohibitive and resource-intensive.
* Low-biomass issues make strain-level microbial identification harder<img width="780" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shihuang047/strain2bfunc/assets/44211414/9c517599-872d-49d7-a303-b3cc4cb11745">
